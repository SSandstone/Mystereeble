8.7.22

My first for fun project that is not a part of The Odin Project Curriculum.

I was definitely not ready for it. I tried to use only what I had already learned which led to a lot of bootleg fixes
I left comments in the script to walk through additional features I'd like to add and some of the logic that was confusing me

I think there is still one uncommon error that I need to fix. Basically if a word contains duplicate letters, I'm having trouble assigning it the right color. I will fix later! And hopefully know more to clean up and simplify a lot of the code.

I'm going to go back to The Odin Project and try to wrap up the foundational course first.
